#	Added checking the NIC's "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power" setting

#	Added link to PVS server sizing for server RAM calculation
#	Added comparing Streaming IP addresses to the IP addresses configured for the server
#		If a streaming IP address does not exist on the server, it is an invalid streaming IP address
#		This is a bug in PVS that allows invalid IP addresses to be added for streaming IPs

#	Added specifying an optional output folder
#	Added the option to email the output file
#	Fixed several spacing and typo errors
